# AutoDeployer
# This auto deployer was created by Jeremy Felts to automate the process of pushing a local django project to a AWS E2 Server. To use this program follow these steps in order:
# 1:Start a AWS E2 Ubuntu free tier server
# 2:Pip freeze into a requirements.txt file in your django project
# 3:Push your project to github
# 4:Modify the config.sh file
# 5:Run AutoDepOne.sh
# 6:Close AutoDepOne.sh when it gets to the end of the code.
# 7:Run AutoDepTwo.sh
# After following these steps, your website should be online at the AWS Public IP. Enjoy!
